<h1>About Me</h1>
<a href="../index.html">Back to homepage</a>
<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I am Abegail, a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing
  a Computer Science degree. My primary dedication lies in sharpening my expertise across programming languages such as 
  Python, C, and Java, while simultaneously delving deep into the complexities of Data Structures, Algorithms, and 
  Object-Oriented Programming through my academic endeavors. Additionally, I am actively enhancing my skill set beyond
   the classroom by engaging in online courses. These courses are focused on broadening my knowledge of front-end and 
   back-end development, with a particular emphasis on mastering HTML, CSS, and React. I earned
  my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration on Business Analytics 
  at Babson College and completed my year-long study program at the 
  London School of Economics where I studied Statistics and Data Analytics. 
</p>

<p>Previously, I have worked as a Data Science Consultant at 33Floors, an IT Consulting Company based in San Francisco, 
  where I worked directly with clients in the real estate industry. In my work, I developed dynamic dashboards in Tableau and Power BI
  fueled by real-time real estate data. Alongside dashboard development, I also automated reports in Excel using PowerPivot, while 
  simultaneously navigating the intricacies of database management systems to extract and analyze data from proprietary databases.
  This professional journey ignited my passion for technology and motivated me to embark on a formal Computer Science education.

<p>Outside of professional and academic spheres, I enjoy painting (oil and watercolor), strength training, dancing, going to EDM concerts, exploring
  new spots in Boston, and spending time with my loved ones. My previous experience with remote working and learning has taught me the importance of work-life balance, which 
  I always strive for. I eagerly anticipate opportunities for engaging projects and internships that allow me to channel my passion and expertise.
